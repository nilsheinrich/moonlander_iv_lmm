linear mixed models analysis for the fourth iteration of the Dodge Asteroids experiment.  
In this experiment, participants were tasked to steer a spaceship and avoid crashing into walls or obstacles. In each trial they encountered up to four drift sections, sections of control loss in which steering was impossible and the spaceship was pushed left or right.  
All analyses can be found in model_selection.Rmd. It contains the exploration for transformations of the predicted variables, exploration for random intercept effects, fixed effects, and random slope effects in that exact order.  
sequential_bayes_updating is an ipython notebook that contains the code for the bayes updating process of the SoC rating after every trial.
As of pushing this readme, data collection is still ongoing. The final preprocessed data file will be pushed in the future.
